# Find A Pet

I'm building this little site to refresh my Rails knowledge, since it's been a while!

This is just a simple website that basically recreates Petfinder.com, using its API. It uses Rails on the backend, and React (TypeScript) on the frontend. I'm using Vite to package the frontend assets.

The code you see here is my own invention - I'm not following any specific tutorial to build this site (although I am doing a lot of googling!)
